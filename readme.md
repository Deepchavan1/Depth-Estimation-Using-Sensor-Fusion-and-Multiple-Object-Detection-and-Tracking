This repository contains the code for a depth estimation system that utilizes sensor fusion of radar and RGB camera data. The system employs object detection and multiple object tracking techniques to estimate the depth of detected objects. It utilizes YOLO-NAS for object detection due to its accuracy and high frames per second (FPS), while DeepSORT is used for multiple object tracking.
